    <h2>Important Notes</h2>

    <h3>1. Market Value</h3>
    <p>Your attention is drawn to the importance of ensuring that the market value of each vehicle is covered by the amount shown on the Policy to avoid under or over-insurance. At the same time please remember that in the event of total loss you will only be entitled to recover the pre-accident market value subject to your estimate stated in the Schedule. You should therefore, in your own interest obtain the current market value of your vehicle(s) each year. A list of approved motor valuers can be obtained from our offices on request.</p>

    <h3>2. Admission of Liability</h3>
    <p>In the event of an accident do not admit liability to any Third Party Claimant or Witness or anyone acting on behalf of a possible Claimant, but obtain full particulars including names and addresses of all witnesses and forward this information at once to us.</p>

    <h3>3. Transfer of Ownership / Cancellation of Policy</h3>
    <p>This being a personal contract it is not transferable to other parties. Thus in the event of the sale of the vehicle(s) or Cancellation of the Policy, certificate of insurance in duplicate MUST be returned to us immediately to facilitate cancellation.</p>
